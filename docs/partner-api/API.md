# Partner Open API Overview

The G2 Sentry Partner API enables seamless integration with G2 Sentryâ€™s guardian service, allowing partners to automate job requests, manage jobs, track statuses, and interact with guardians. The API is built using the OpenAPI 3.1.0 standard, ensuring compatibility and ease of use with modern development tools.

## Key Features

- **Authentication:** Secure access using JWT tokens. Partners authenticate with their key and secret to obtain access and refresh tokens.
- **Job Management:** Create, update, cancel, and review jobs for your clients. Retrieve job details and real-time status.
- **Guardian Operations:** Access guardian profiles assigned to jobs.
- **Callbacks:** Receive real-time job status updates via callbacks to your platform.  
  *See [Callbacks](./Callbacks.md) for details.*
- **RESTful Design:** All endpoints follow REST principles for predictable integration.
